"Note: Except for the annual standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide, the 2020 Canadian Ambient Air Quality Standards use 3-year average concentrations. For this reason, the bar chart portrays percentage values over 3-year periods. The annual standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide use a single annual concentration for the 3-year reporting period. For example, for the 2020 to 2022 reporting period, the annual concentrations for 2022 were used for the annual standards for nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide.",
