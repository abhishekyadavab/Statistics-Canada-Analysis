# 🌍 StatsCanada Insights: Exploring Health, Environment, and Social Trends in Canada 📊

**Visualizing Canada’s Well-being with R and ggplot2**

Welcome to **StatsCanada Insights**, a major data visualization project developed as part of my Business Analytics studies. This project focuses on three critical areas of Canadian life—**Health**, **Environment**, and **Social Connectedness**—using official datasets from **Statistics Canada**. With R and ggplot2, I’ve transformed raw data into meaningful visual narratives, culminating in an engaging infographic that summarizes key findings.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes and visualizes Statistics Canada data in three thematic domains:

### 🩺 Health
- Life expectancy across provinces
- Mental health status trends
- Adherence to 24-hour movement guidelines

### 🌱 Environment
- Air quality index vs. Canadian standards
- National GHG emissions over time
- Water usage patterns in cubic meters

### 🤝 Social Connectedness
- Sense of belonging to local communities
- Availability of personal support networks
- Gender and province-wise comparisons

**Tools Used**: R, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyverse, patchwork, readr  
**Data Source**: Statistics Canada & Canadian Community Health Survey

## 🎨 Visualizations and Insights

### 1. Health Domain 🩺  
**Key Insight**: Quebec reports the highest life expectancy (71.6 years), while Newfoundland is the lowest (66.3 years).  
**Mental Health**: 20.7% of Canadians reported poor mental health in 2023.  
**Activity Trends**: Varying adherence to physical activity guidelines (2016–2021).  

📂 **Scripts**: `health.R`, `health 24 hours.R`  
🖼️ **Output**: `unified_health_analysis.png`

---

### 2. Environment Domain 🌱  
**Air Quality**: Improved from 63% (2005) to 85% (2019), but dropped to 74% in 2020.  
**GHG Emissions**: Peaked in 2007 at 774 Mt CO₂ eq; declined to 694 Mt by 2023.  
**Water Usage**: Consistent variations across provinces and years.  

📂 **Scripts**: `environment.R`, `water usage.R`  
🖼️ **Output**: `environment_plot.png`, `water_usage.png`

### 3. Social Connectedness Domain 🤝  
**Belonging**: Alberta scores highest (66.9%); Newfoundland lowest (51.9%).  
**Support Network**: British Columbia leads with 68.6% of people having someone to count on.  

📂 **Scripts**: `social.R`, `sense of belonging.R`  
🖼️ **Output**: `social_connectedness_dot_plot.png`
